prompt_builder.py
-----------------
Builds strictly constrained prompts for AI generation.

Key principles (from the design review):
- AI receives constraints, not creative latitude.
- AI must not invent world facts — it fills predefined gaps.
- Only the *relevant subgraph* of MachineState is injected (context budget).
- Filenames and paths are sanitized before interpolation (prompt-injection hardening).
- Refusal boilerplate ("As an AI...") is checked post-generation by the Validator.
